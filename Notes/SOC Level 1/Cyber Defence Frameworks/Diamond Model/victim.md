# Victim

A **victim** is the target of an adversary. This can include organizations, individuals, email addresses, IP addresses, domains, and more. It's important to distinguish between the *victim persona* and *victim assets*, as they serve different analytical purposes.

A victim represents an opportunity for attackers to gain a foothold within an organization. In every cyberattack, there is always a victim. For example, in a spear-phishing attack, a carefully crafted email targets a specific person within a company. If someone clicks the malicious link, that person becomes the victimâ€”the selected target of interest for the adversary.

## Victim Personae

Victim personae are the people and organizations being targeted, whose assets are attacked or exploited. Examples include:

- Organization names
- Individuals' names
- Industries
- Job roles
- Interests

## Victim Assets

Victim assets represent the attack surface and include the systems and resources adversaries target, such as:

- Systems and networks
- Email addresses
- Hosts
- IP addresses
- Social networking accounts

Understanding both the victim persona and victim assets is essential for effective cyber defense analysis.
