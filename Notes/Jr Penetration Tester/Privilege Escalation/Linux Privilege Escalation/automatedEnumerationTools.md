Several tools can help you save time during the enumeration process. These tools should only be used to save time knowing they may miss some privilege escalation vectors. Below is a list of popular Linux enumeration tools with links to their respective GitHub repositories.

The target systemâ€™s environment will influence the tool you will be able to use. For example, you will not be able to run a tool written in Python if it is not installed on the target system. This is why it would be better to be familiar with a few rather than having a single go-to tool.
