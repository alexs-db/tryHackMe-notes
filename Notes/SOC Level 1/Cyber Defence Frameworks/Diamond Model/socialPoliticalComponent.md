## Social-Political Component

The social-political component describes the needs and intent of the adversary. Common motivations include:

- Financial gain
- Gaining acceptance in the hacker community
- Hacktivism
- Espionage

**Example Scenario:**  
A victim provides a "product," such as computing resources and bandwidth, which is used as a zombie in a botnet for crypto mining. In this case, the adversary consumes the victim's resources to mine cryptocurrencies or achieve financial gain.
