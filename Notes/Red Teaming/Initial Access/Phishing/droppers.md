# Droppers

Droppers are software that phishing victims are often tricked into downloading and running on their systems. These programs may present themselves as something useful or legitimate, such as a codec for viewing a specific video or software for opening a particular file.

Typically, droppers are not inherently malicious, allowing them to bypass antivirus checks. Once executed, they either unpack or download the intended malware from a remote server and install it on the victim's computer. The malicious software then connects back to the attacker's infrastructure, enabling the attacker to take control of the victim's computer and potentially explore and exploit the local network further.
