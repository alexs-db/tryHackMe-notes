## Key Terms Overview

Before diving in, let's briefly discuss a few terms you will often encounter when dealing with the MITRE framework and threat intelligence.

### APT (Advanced Persistent Threat)

An **APT** is a team, group (threat group), or even a nation-state that engages in long-term attacks against organizations or countries. The term "advanced" can be misleading, as it suggests that every APT group possesses highly sophisticated tools, such as zero-day exploits. In reality, many of the techniques used by APT groups are common and can be detected with proper security measures.

### TTP (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures)

**TTP** stands for **Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures**:

- **Tactic:** The adversary's goal or objective.
- **Technique:** How the adversary achieves that goal or objective.
- **Procedure:** The specific way the technique is executed.

If these definitions are unclear now, don't worryâ€”TTPs will become clearer as you progress through each section.
