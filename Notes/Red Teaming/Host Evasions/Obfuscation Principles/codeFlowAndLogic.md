# Control Flow and Logic

Control flow is a critical component of a program’s execution that defines how a program logically proceeds. Logic is one of the most significant determining factors of an application’s control flow and encompasses various constructs such as `if/else` statements and loops. A program traditionally executes from top to bottom; when a logic statement is encountered, execution follows the statement’s path.

## Common Logic Statements

Below is a table of some logic statements you may encounter when dealing with control flows or program logic:

| Logic Statement | Purpose |
|-----------------|---------|
| `if/else`       | Executes a code block only if a condition is met; otherwise, executes an alternative block. |
| `try/catch`     | Attempts to execute a code block and handles errors if they occur. |
| `switch case`   | Similar to `if` statements but checks several possible conditions with cases before resolving to a `break` or `default`. |
| `for/while loop`| Executes repeatedly while a condition is met (`for` for a set number of times, `while` until the condition is false). |

## Example

To make this concept concrete, observe the following example function and its corresponding Control Flow Graph (CFG), which depicts possible control flow paths:

```python
x = 10
if x > 7:
    print("This executes")
else:
    print("This is ignored")
```

## Implications for Attackers

An analyst can attempt to understand a program’s function through its control flow. However, logic and control flow are almost effortless to manipulate and make arbitrarily confusing. When dealing with control flow, an attacker aims to introduce enough obscure and arbitrary logic to confuse an analyst, but not so much as to raise suspicion or be detected as malicious.
