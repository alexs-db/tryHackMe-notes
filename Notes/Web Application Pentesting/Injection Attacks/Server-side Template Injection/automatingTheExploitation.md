# Automating the Exploitation of SSTI Vulnerabilities with SSTImap

SSTImap is a tool that automates the process of testing and exploiting SSTI vulnerabilities in various template engines. Hosted on GitHub, it provides a framework for discovering template injection flaws.

## Installation

### Using AttackBox
The tool is installed in the `/opt/SSTImap` directory.

### Using Your Own Machine
You can install it by cloning the repository from GitHub and setting up its environment. Here's how you can get started:

#### Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/vladko312/SSTImap.git
```

#### Navigate to the SSTImap Directory
```bash
cd SSTImap
```

#### Install Dependencies
If any dependencies are listed (usually via a `requirements.txt` file), install them:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Features

SSTImap is capable of the following:

- **Template Engine Detection**: SSTImap can help identify the template engine used by a web application, which is crucial for crafting specific exploits.
- **Automated Exploitation**: For known vulnerabilities, SSTImap can automate the process of exploiting them.

## Usage

You can use SSTImap by providing it with the target URL and any necessary options. Here’s a simple usage example:

```bash
python3 sstimap.py -X POST -u 'http://ssti.thm:8002/mako/' -d 'page='
```

This command attempts to detect the SSTI vulnerability using tailored payloads.

### Example Output

```bash
user@tryhackme $ python3 sstimap.py -X POST -u 'http://ssti.thm:8002/mako/' -d 'page='
