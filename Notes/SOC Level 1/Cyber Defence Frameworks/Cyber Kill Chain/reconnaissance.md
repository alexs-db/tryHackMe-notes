# Reconnaissance

Reconnaissance is the process of discovering and collecting information about a target system or victim. From an attacker's perspective, this is the planning phase where adversaries gather as much information as possible to prepare for further stages of an attack.

## What is Reconnaissance?

Reconnaissance involves identifying and collecting data such as company size, email addresses, phone numbers, and other publicly available information. This helps attackers determine the best targets and methods for their attack.

### OSINT (Open-Source Intelligence)

OSINT refers to gathering intelligence from publicly available sources. It is often the first step in the reconnaissance phase. Attackers use OSINT to study their victims by collecting information about the company and its employees.

## Attacker's Perspective

Imagine an attacker named "Megatron" planning a sophisticated attack. Before proceeding, Megatron must conduct reconnaissance to gather information about potential targets.

### Email Harvesting

Email harvesting is the process of obtaining email addresses from public, paid, or free sources. Attackers use harvested emails for phishing attacksâ€”social engineering techniques designed to steal sensitive data like login credentials and credit card numbers.

## Common Reconnaissance Tools

- **theHarvester**: Gathers emails, names, subdomains, IPs, and URLs from multiple public data sources.
- **Hunter.io**: Finds contact information associated with a domain.
- **OSINT Framework**: Provides a collection of OSINT tools organized by category.

## Social Media

Attackers also use social media platforms such as LinkedIn, Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram to collect information about specific individuals or companies. Information found on social media can be valuable for conducting phishing attacks.
