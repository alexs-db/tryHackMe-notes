# Command and Control (C2)

## What is Command and Control (C2)?

C2 frameworks are post-exploitation frameworks that allow red teamers to collaborate and control compromised machines. C2 is considered one of the most important tools for red teamers during offensive cyber operations. These frameworks provide fast and efficient ways to:

- Generate various malicious payloads  
- Enumerate compromised machines and networks  
- Perform privilege escalation and pivoting  
- Conduct lateral movement  
- And much more  

Some of the most popular C2 frameworks that we will briefly highlight are **Cobalt Strike**, **PowerShell Empire**, and **Metasploit**. Most of these frameworks aim to support a convenient environment for sharing and communication among red team operations once initial access to a system is obtained.

## Cobalt Strike

Cobalt Strike is a commercial framework focused on **Adversary Simulations** and **Red Team Operations**. It combines remote access tools, post-exploitation capabilities, and a unique reporting system.  

It provides an advanced agent that enables **covert communications** and allows various operations, including:

- Keylogging  
- File upload and exfiltration  
- VPN deployment  
- Privilege escalation techniques  
- **Mimikatz** integration  
- Port scanning  
- Advanced lateral movement

## PowerShell Empire

**PowerShell Empire** is an open-source framework that helps **red team operators and pentesters collaborate across multiple servers** using keys and shared passwords.  

It is an exploitation framework based on **PowerShell and Python agents**, primarily used for **client-side attacks and post-exploitation within Windows and Active Directory environments**.

## Metasploit

Metasploit is a widely used exploitation framework that offers **various techniques and tools to simplify hacking**.  

### Why use Metasploit?
- It is an **open-source** framework  
- It is considered one of the **primary tools for pentesting and Red Team operations**  
- It allows the generation of **custom payloads** for the **weaponization stage**
