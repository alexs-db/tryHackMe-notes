# What Is a Kill Chain?

Originating from the military, a **Kill Chain** is a term used to describe the various stages of an attack. In cybersecurity, a Kill Chain outlines the methodology or path that attackers—such as hackers or Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs)—use to approach and compromise a target.

For example, an attacker might scan for vulnerabilities, exploit a web weakness, and escalate privileges. This sequence of actions forms a Kill Chain. The specific stages will be explained in greater detail later in this room.

The main objective is to understand an attacker's Kill Chain so that defensive measures can be implemented to either proactively protect a system or disrupt an attacker's attempt.
