Before discussing insecure deserialization in detail, it's crucial to understand the basic concept through a simple example.

## Serialization

Think of serialization like packing your school bag in the morning. You have books, notebooks, a lunchbox, and a water bottle, which you need to organize into your bag. Serialization is just like taking different pieces of information (like notes) and putting them together to make them easy to store or send to a friend.

### Serialization Workflow

In programming, serialization is the process of transforming an object's state into a human-readable or binary format (or a mix of both) that can be stored or transmitted and reconstructed as and when required. This capability is essential in applications where data must be transferred between different parts of a system or across a network, such as in web-based applications.

### Example

```php
<?php
$noteArray = array("title" => "My THM Note", "content" => "Welcome to THM!");
$serializedNote = serialize($noteArray);  // Converting the note into a storable format
file_put_contents('note.txt', $serializedNote);  // Saving the serialized note to a file
?>
```

The following output shows the serialized string in the `note.txt` file, which includes details of the note's structure and content. It’s stored in a way that can be easily saved or transmitted.

**Serialized Note:** `a:2:{s:5:"title";s:12:"My THM Note";s:7:"content";s:12:"Welcome to THM!";}`

## Deserialization

Imagine you arrive at school and need everything you packed this morning. Deserialization is like unpacking your school bag when you get to class; you take out each item so you can use it throughout the day. As you unpack your bag to get your books and lunch, deserialization takes the packed-up data and turns it back into something you can use. Deserialization is the process of converting the formatted data back into an object. It's crucial for retrieving data from files, databases, or across networks, restoring it to its original state for usage in applications.

### Deserialization Workflow

Following our previous example, here's how you might deserialize the note data in PHP:

```php
<?php
$serializedNote = file_get_contents('note.txt');  // Reading the serialized note from the file
$noteArray = unserialize($serializedNote);  // Converting the serialized string back into a PHP array
echo "Title: " . $noteArray['title'] . "<br>";
echo "Content: " . $noteArray['content'];
?>
```

This code reads the serialized note from a file and converts it back into an array, effectively reconstructing the original note. Discussing serialization also necessitates a conversation about security. Like you wouldn’t want someone tampering with your school bag, insecure deserialization can lead to significant security vulnerabilities in software applications. Attackers might alter serialized objects to execute unauthorized actions or steal data.

## Specific Incidents Involving Serialization Vulnerabilities

Let's discuss specific incidents where serialization vulnerabilities played a critical role in cybersecurity breaches or attacks, highlighting the importance of secure serialization practices. These examples illustrate how attackers exploit serialization flaws to achieve remote code execution, data leakage, and more.

### Log4j Vulnerability CVE-2021-44228

**Incident:** The Log4j vulnerability, or Log4Shell, is a critical security flaw found in the Apache Log4j 2 library, a widely used logging library in Java applications. The vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected systems by exploiting the library's insecure deserialization functionality. If you want to learn more about this vulnerability, check out the Solar, exploiting log4j room.

**Impact:** The vulnerability facilitated remote code execution, enabling attackers to execute arbitrary commands on affected systems. This allowed attackers to compromise critical infrastructure, leading to unauthorized access to sensitive data, service disruptions, and potential supply chain attacks.

### WebLogic Server Remote Code Execution CVE-2015-4852

**Incident:** This vulnerability was related to how the Oracle WebLogic Server deserialized data sent to the T3 protocol. Attackers could send maliciously crafted objects to the server, which, when deserialized, led to remote code execution.

**Impact:** This vulnerability was widely exploited to gain unauthorized access to systems, deploy ransomware, or steal data. It affected all versions of the WebLogic Server that had not disabled the vulnerable service or patched the issue.

### Jenkins Java Deserialization CVE-2016-0792

**Incident:** Jenkins, a popular automation server used in software development, experienced a critical vulnerability involving Java deserialization. Attackers could send crafted serialization payloads to the Jenkins CLI, which, when deserialized, could allow arbitrary code execution.

**Impact:** This allowed attackers to execute shell commands, potentially taking over the Jenkins server, which often has broad access to a software development environment, including source code, build systems, and potentially deployment environments.
