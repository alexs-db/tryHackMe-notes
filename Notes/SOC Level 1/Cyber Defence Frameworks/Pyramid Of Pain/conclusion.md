## Conclusion

You have now learned the concept of the Pyramid of Pain. It's time to apply this knowledge in practice. Please navigate to the Static Site to perform the exercise.

As an additional exercise, you can pick any APT (Advanced Persistent Threat) group to research. A good starting point is the [Rapid7 Advanced Persistent Threat Groups](https://attack.mitre.org/groups/). Once you have selected an APT group, find their indicators and ask yourself:

- What detection rules or approaches can I create to detect the adversary's activity?
- Where does this activity or detection fall on the Pyramid of Pain?

As David Bianco states:

> "The amount of pain you cause an adversary depends on the types of indicators you are able to make use of."
