# urlScan.io

Urlscan.io is a free service designed to scan and analyze websites. It automates browsing and crawling, recording activities and interactions for submitted URLs.

## How It Works

When a URL is submitted, urlScan.io records:

- Domains and IP addresses contacted
- Resources requested from those domains
- A snapshot of the web page
- Technologies used
- Other metadata about the website

## Views

Urlscan.io provides two main views:

- **Recent Scans:** Displays the most recent scans performed.
- **Live Scans:** Shows current live scans in progress.

## Scan Results

Scan results offer detailed information in several key areas:

- **Summary:** General info about the URL, including IP address, domain registration, page history, and a screenshot.
- **HTTP:** Details on HTTP connections made, data fetched, and file types received.
- **Redirects:** Information on HTTP and client-side redirects.
- **Links:** All outgoing links identified from the homepage.
- **Behaviour:** Variables and cookies found, useful for identifying frameworks used.
- **Indicators:** Lists all IPs, domains, and hashes associated with the site (not necessarily malicious).

> **Note:** Due to the dynamic nature of the internet, scan results may vary over time as new information becomes available.
