# Threat Intelligence

Threat Intelligence involves analyzing data and information using various tools and techniques to identify meaningful patterns. This helps organizations, industries, sectors, or governments mitigate potential risks from existing or emerging threats.

## Key Questions for Risk Mitigation

- **Who's attacking you?**
- **What's their motivation?**
- **What are their capabilities?**
- **What artefacts and indicators of compromise should you look out for?**

## Threat Intelligence Classifications

Threat Intelligence focuses on understanding the relationship between your operational environment and adversaries. It can be classified into:

### Strategic Intelligence

High-level intelligence that examines the organization's threat landscape, identifying risk areas based on trends, patterns, and emerging threats. This informs business decisions.

### Technical Intelligence

Analyzes evidence and artefacts of attacks used by adversaries. Incident Response teams use this intelligence to establish a baseline attack surface and develop defense mechanisms.

### Tactical Intelligence

Assesses adversaries' tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs). This intelligence strengthens security controls and addresses vulnerabilities through real-time investigations.

### Operational Intelligence

Examines adversaries' specific motives and intent to perform attacks. Security teams use this intelligence to understand which critical assets (people, processes, technologies) may be targeted within the organization.
