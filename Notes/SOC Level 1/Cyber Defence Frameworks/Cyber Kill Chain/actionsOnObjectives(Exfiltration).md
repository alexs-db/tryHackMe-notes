## Actions on Objectives (Exfiltration)

After progressing through the first six phases of the attack, "Megatron" can finally take action on the original objectives. With hands-on keyboard access, the attacker may:

- **Collect user credentials**
- **Perform privilege escalation**  
    Gain elevated access (e.g., domain administrator) by exploiting misconfigurations.
- **Conduct internal reconnaissance**  
    Interact with internal software to identify vulnerabilities.
- **Move laterally**  
    Traverse through the company's environment to access additional systems.
- **Collect and exfiltrate sensitive data**
- **Delete backups and shadow copies**  
    *Shadow Copy* is a Microsoft technology that creates backup copies or snapshots of files/volumes.
- **Overwrite or corrupt data**

These actions enable the attacker to achieve their ultimate goals and maximize the impact on the target organization.
