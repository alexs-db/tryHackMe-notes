# Mitigation Measures for SSRF

Mitigation measures for SSRF are essential for preserving the security and integrity of web applications. Implementing robust SSRF mitigation measures helps protect against these risks by fortifying the application's defenses, preventing malicious requests, and bolstering the overall security posture. As a critical element of web application security, SSRF mitigation measures are instrumental in preserving user data, safeguarding against data breaches, and maintaining trust in the digital ecosystem. A few of the important policies are mentioned below:

## Various Techniques for Mitigation

- **Implement strict input validation and sanitization**: Ensure all user-provided input, especially any URLs or input parameters the application uses to make external requests, is validated and sanitized.
- **Use allowlists**: Instead of trying to blocklist or filter out disallowed URLs, maintain allowlists of trusted URLs or domains. Only allow requests to these trusted sources.
- **Network segmentation**: Isolate sensitive internal resources from external access.
- **Security headers**: Implement security headers, such as Content-Security-Policy, that restrict the application's load of external resources.
- **Strong access controls**: Ensure strong access controls for internal resources, so even if an attacker succeeds in making a request, they can't access sensitive data without proper authorization.
- **Comprehensive logging and monitoring**: Track and analyze incoming requests. Look for unusual or unauthorized requests and set up alerts for suspicious activity.
