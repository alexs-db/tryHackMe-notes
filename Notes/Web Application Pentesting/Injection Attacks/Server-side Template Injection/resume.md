## Conclusion

Congratulations on completing the Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI) room! Here's a recap of the key concepts we've covered:

### Template Engine Basics
We explored how template engines like Jinja2, Pug (Jade), and Smarty work in web development, highlighting their role in dynamically generating web content.

### Understanding SSTI
You've learned what SSTI is, how it occurs, and the potential risks associated with template engines when they process user input without proper sanitization.

### Mitigation Techniques
Techniques for preventing SSTI, including sandboxing, input validation, and secure configuration of template engines, were discussed to help you secure your applications.

### Detecting Template Engines
We covered methods to identify which template engine an application is using through basic payloads, enhancing your ability to tailor security measures to specific environments.
