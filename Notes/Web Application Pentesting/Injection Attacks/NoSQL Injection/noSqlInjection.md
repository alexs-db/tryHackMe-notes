First, let's start the Virtual Machine by pressing the Start Machine button at the top of this task. You may access the VM using the AttackBox or your VPN connection. Once the machine is ready, navigate to `http://MACHINE_IP` to start the exercise.

## Injection is Injection

While it may seem complex to think about NoSQL Injection, when we boil down injection attacks to their very essence, we can understand the similarities between SQL Injection and NoSQL Injection.

The root cause of an injection attack is that improper concatenation of untrusted user input into a command can allow an attacker to alter the command itself. With SQL injection, the most common approach is to inject a single or double quote, that terminates the current data concatenation and allows the attacker to modify the query. The same approach applies to NoSQL Injection. If untrusted user input is directly added to the query, we have the opportunity to modify the query itself. However, with NoSQL Injection, even if we can't escape the current query, we still have the opportunity to manipulate the query itself. Therefore, there are two main types of NoSQL Injection:

- **Syntax Injection**: This is similar to SQL injection, where we have the ability to break out of the query and inject our own payload. The key difference to SQL injection is the syntax used to perform the injection attack.
- **Operator Injection**: Even if we can't break out of the query, we could potentially inject a NoSQL query operator that manipulates the query's behavior, allowing us to stage attacks such as authentication bypasses.

In this room, our main focus will be on Operator Injection and the different ways it can be leveraged. This is because it is not as common to find Syntax Injection cases as most libraries used to create the queries apply filters that prevent you from injection into the syntax. However, since user input can vary, these same filters can often be vulnerable to Operator Injection. However, we will cover a Syntax Injection example at the end of the room.

## How to Inject NoSQL

When looking at how NoSQL filters are built, bypassing them to inject any payload might look impossible, as they rely on creating a structured array. Unlike SQL injection, where queries were normally built by simple string concatenation, NoSQL queries require nested associative arrays. From an attacker's point of view, this means that to inject NoSQL, one must be able to inject arrays into the application.

Luckily for us, many server-side programming languages allow passing array variables by using a special syntax on the query string of an HTTP Request. For the purpose of this example, let's focus on the following code written in PHP for a simple login page:

```php
<?php
$con = new MongoDB\Driver\Manager("mongodb://localhost:27017");

if(isset($_POST) && isset($_POST['user']) && isset($_POST['pass'])){
        $user = $_POST['user'];
        $pass = $_POST['pass'];

        $q = new MongoDB\Driver\Query(['username'=>$user, 'password'=>$pass]);
        $record = $con->executeQuery('myapp.login', $q );
        $record = iterator_to_array($record);

        if(sizeof($record)>0){
                $usr = $record[0];

                session_start();
                $_SESSION['loggedin'] = true;
                $_SESSION['uid'] = $usr->username;

                header('Location: /sekr3tPl4ce.php');
                die();
        }
}
header('Location: /?err=1');
?>
```

The web application is making a query to MongoDB, using the "myapp" database and "login" collection, requesting any document that passes the filter `['username'=>$user, 'password'=>$pass]`, where both `$user` and `$pass` are obtained directly from HTTP POST parameters. Let's take a look at how we can leverage Operator Injection in order to bypass authentication.

If somehow we could send an array to the `$user` and `$pass` variables with the following content:

```php
$user = ['$ne'=>'xxxx'];
$pass = ['$ne'=>'yyyy'];
```

The resulting filter would end up looking like this:

```php
['username'=>['$ne'=>'xxxx'], 'password'=>['$ne'=>'yyyy']];
```

We could trick the database into returning any document where the username isn't equal to 'xxxx,' and the password isn't equal to 'yyyy'. This would probably return all documents in the login collection. As a result, the application would assume a correct login was performed and let us into the application with the privileges of the user corresponding to the first document obtained from the database.

The problem that remains unsolved is how to pass an array as part of a POST HTTP Request. It turns out that PHP and many other languages allow you to pass an array by using the following notation on the POST Request Body:

```
user[$ne]=xxxx&pass[$ne]=yyyy
```

So let's fire up our favorite proxy and try to test this. For this guide, we will be using Burp Proxy.
