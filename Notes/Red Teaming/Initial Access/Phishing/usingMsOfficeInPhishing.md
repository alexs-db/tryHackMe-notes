## Using Microsoft Office in Phishing Campaigns

During phishing campaigns, attackers often include a Microsoft Office document (such as Word, Excel, or PowerPoint) as an attachment. These documents can contain macros, which, while having legitimate uses, can also execute commands that install malware on the victim's computer or establish a connection back to the attacker's network, granting them control over the victim's system.

### Example Scenario

Imagine the following situation:

A staff member at Acme IT Support receives an email from what appears to be the human resources department. The email includes an Excel spreadsheet named **"Staff_Salaries.xlsx"**, supposedly intended for the boss but mistakenly sent to the staff member.

In reality, the attacker spoofed the human resources email address and crafted a convincing email designed to entice the staff member into opening the attachment.

Once the staff member opens the attachment and enables macros, their computer becomes compromised.
