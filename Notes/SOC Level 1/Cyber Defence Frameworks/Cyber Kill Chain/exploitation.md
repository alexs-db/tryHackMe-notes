## Exploitation

To gain access to a system, an attacker must exploit a vulnerability. In this phase, "Megatron" got creative by crafting two phishing emails:

- One email contained a phishing link to a fake Office 365 login page.
- The other included a macro attachment that would execute ransomware when opened.

"Megatron" successfully delivered these exploits, resulting in two victims clicking the malicious link and opening the malicious file.

After initial access, a malicious actor may exploit software, system, or server-based vulnerabilities to escalate privileges or move laterally within the network. According to CrowdStrike, **lateral movement** refers to techniques used by attackers to move deeper into a network after gaining initial access, aiming to obtain sensitive data.

> **Tip:** To learn more about server-based or web-based vulnerabilities, refer to the TryHackMe room: **OWASP Top 10**.

Attackers might also use a **zero-day exploit** at this stage. According to FireEye:

> "A zero-day exploit or zero-day vulnerability is an unknown exploit in the wild that exposes a vulnerability in software or hardware and can create complicated problems well before anyone realizes something is wrong. A zero-day exploit leaves NO opportunity for detection at the beginning."

### Examples of Exploitation Techniques

- The victim triggers the exploit by opening a malicious email attachment or clicking a phishing link.
- Using a zero-day exploit.
- Exploiting software, hardware, or even human vulnerabilities.
- Triggering exploits for server-based vulnerabilities.
