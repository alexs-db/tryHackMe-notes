# Introduction to MITRE

If you're new to cybersecurity, you may not have heard of MITRE. Many experienced professionals associate MITRE primarily with the CVE (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures) list—a key resource for researching vulnerabilities and exploits. However, MITRE's work extends far beyond cybersecurity, supporting the safety, stability, and well-being of the nation in areas such as artificial intelligence, health informatics, and space security.

> **From [mitre.org](https://www.mitre.org/):**  
> "At MITRE, we solve problems for a safer world. Through our federally funded R&D centers and public-private partnerships, we work across government to tackle challenges to the safety, stability, and well-being of our nation."

In this room, we'll focus on several MITRE projects and research initiatives that benefit the cybersecurity community, including:

- **ATT&CK®** (Adversarial Tactics, Techniques, and Common Knowledge) Framework
- **CAR** (Cyber Analytics Repository) Knowledge Base
- **ENGAGE** (not an acronym)
- **D3FEND** (Detection, Denial, and Disruption Framework Empowering Network Defense)
- **AEP** (ATT&CK Emulation Plans)

Let's dive in!
