# Introduction to Encoding and Encryption

## What is Encoding?

Encoding is the process of transforming data from its original state into a specific format, depending on the algorithm or type of encoding. It can be applied to various data types such as videos, HTML, URLs, and binary files (e.g., EXE, images).

Encoding is commonly used for purposes including:

- Program compiling and execution
- Data storage and transmission
- Data processing, such as file conversion

In the context of AV evasion techniques, encoding can be used to hide shellcode strings within a binary. However, encoding alone is not sufficient for evasion, as modern AV software can analyze binaries and decode encoded strings to inspect their original content.

To increase complexity, multiple encoding algorithms can be used in tandem. For example, converting the string "THM" to its hexadecimal representation and then encoding it with Base64. In such cases, your dropper must handle the decoding process to restore the original string.

> **Double Text Encoding Technique Example:**  
> "THM" → Hexadecimal → Base64

## What is Encryption?

Encryption is a fundamental aspect of information and data security, designed to prevent unauthorized access and manipulation. It involves converting plaintext (unencrypted content) into ciphertext (encrypted content), which cannot be read or decrypted without the appropriate algorithm and key.

Encryption is used for:

- Secure data storage and transmission
- End-to-end encryption

Encryption can be implemented using a shared key (symmetric encryption) or public/private keys (asymmetric encryption).

For more information, see the [Encryption - Crypto 101 room](#).

## Why Learn About Encoding and Encryption?

AV vendors often blocklist public tools (such as Metasploit) using static or dynamic detection techniques. Without modifying the shellcode generated by these tools, your dropper is likely to be detected.

Encoding and encryption can be used in AV evasion techniques to hide shellcode within a dropper during runtime. These techniques can also be applied to hide functions, variables, and more. In this context, the focus is on encrypting shellcode to evade Windows Defender.
