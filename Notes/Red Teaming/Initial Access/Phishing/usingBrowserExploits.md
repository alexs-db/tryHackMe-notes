# Using Browser Exploits for Initial Access

Another method of gaining control over a victim's computer could be through **browser exploits**. This occurs when there is a vulnerability in the browser itself (e.g., Internet Explorer/Edge, Firefox, Chrome, Safari), allowing the attacker to execute remote commands on the victim's computer.

Browser exploits are not typically a common path in a red team engagement unless there is prior knowledge of outdated technology being used on-site. Many browsers are frequently updated, making them harder to exploit due to modern development practices. Additionally, such exploits are often highly valuable and may be reported to developers for monetary rewards.

That said, browser exploits can still occur. They may be used to target outdated technologies on-site, especially in cases where browser software cannot be updated due to compatibility issues with commercial software or hardware. This scenario is common in large institutions such as education, government, and healthcare.

### Attack Vector

1. The victim receives an email designed to convince them to visit a specific website set up by the attacker.
2. Once the victim visits the site, the exploit targets the browser vulnerability.
3. The attacker gains the ability to execute commands on the victim's computer.

### Example

An example of such an exploit is **CVE-2021-40444**, disclosed in September 2021. This vulnerability in Microsoft systems allowed code execution simply by visiting a malicious website.
