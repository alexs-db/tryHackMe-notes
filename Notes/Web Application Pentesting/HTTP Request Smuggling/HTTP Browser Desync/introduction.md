# Introduction

Request smuggling traditionally focuses on issues within the communication between frontend and backend servers or between backend servers in a proxy or load-balancing setup. The attention may not have been extensively directed toward understanding how these vulnerabilities manifest and can be explicitly exploited in how web browsers interpret and handle these smuggled requests.

Desynchronizing the interpretation of requests within browsers adds a layer of complexity and opens up new possibilities for exploitation. This new technique necessitates only the desynchronization of the front-end server, impacting the victim's connection with their browser.

## Objectives

- Understand what HTTP Request Browser Desync is and its impact
- Identify Browser HTTP Request Smuggling vulnerabilities in web applications
- Exploit the vulnerability in a controlled environment

## Pre-requisites

- A strong understanding of the HTTP protocol
- Prior experience with traditional Request Smuggling techniques in Server-side contexts
- An understanding of client-side attacks is foundational
