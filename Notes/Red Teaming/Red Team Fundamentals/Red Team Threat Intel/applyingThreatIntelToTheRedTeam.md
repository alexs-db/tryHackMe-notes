# Leveraging Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) for Adversary Emulation

As previously mentioned, the **red team** will leverage **Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI)** to aid in **adversary emulation** and support **evidence of an adversary's behaviors**.

## Consuming CTI and Collecting TTPs

To efficiently **consume CTI** and **collect Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs)**, red teams often rely on **threat intelligence platforms** and **frameworks**, such as:

- **MITRE ATT&CK**
- **TIBER-EU**
- **OST Map**

These **cyber frameworks** gather **known TTPs** and categorize them based on various characteristics, including:

- **Threat Group**
- **Kill Chain Phase**
- **Tactic**
- **Objective/Goal**

## Mapping TTPs to a Cyber Kill Chain

Once a **targeted adversary** is selected, the objective is to **identify all TTPs** associated with that adversary and **map them to a known cyber kill chain**.  
This concept will be explored in greater detail in the next task.

## Role of TTPs in Red Team Planning

Leveraging **TTPs** serves as a **planning technique** rather than something the team focuses on during **engagement execution**.  
Depending on the **team size**, a **CTI team** or **threat intelligence operator** may be responsible for gathering TTPs for the **red team**.

During the **execution phase** of an engagement, the **red team** will use **threat intelligence** to:

- **Develop tooling**
- **Modify C2 traffic and behavior**
- **Emulate the targeted adversary**

This process will be **further detailed in Task 5**.

## Conclusion

In summary, the **red team** consumes **threat intelligence** to **analyze and emulate adversary behaviors** by leveraging **collected TTPs** and **Indicators of Compromise (IOCs)**.
