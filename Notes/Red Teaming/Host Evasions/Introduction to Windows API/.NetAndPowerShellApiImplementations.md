# .NET and PowerShell API Implementations

## P/Invoke in .NET

As discussed in task 4, P/Invoke allows us to import DLLs and assign pointers to API calls.

To understand how P/Invoke is implemented, let’s jump right into it with an example below and discuss individual components afterward:

```csharp
class Win32 {
    [DllImport("kernel32")]
    public static extern IntPtr GetComputerNameA(StringBuilder lpBuffer, ref uint lpnSize);
}
```

The class function stores defined API calls and a definition to reference in all future methods.

### Key Points:
1. **DLL Import**: The library in which the API call structure is stored must now be imported using `DllImport`. The imported DLLs act similar to header packages but require you to import a specific DLL with the API call you are looking for. You can reference the API index or [pinvoke.net](https://www.pinvoke.net/) to determine where a particular API call is located in a DLL.
2. **Pointer Creation**: From the DLL import, we can create a new pointer to the API call we want to use, notably defined by `IntPtr`. Unlike other low-level languages, you must specify the in/out parameter structure in the pointer. As discussed in task 5, we can find the in/out parameters for the required API call from the Windows documentation.

### Example Application:
Below is an example application that uses the API to get the computer name and other information of the device it is run on:

```csharp
class Win32 {
    [DllImport("kernel32")]
    public static extern IntPtr GetComputerNameA(StringBuilder lpBuffer, ref uint lpnSize);
}

static void Main(string[] args) {
    bool success;
    StringBuilder name = new StringBuilder(260);
    uint size = 260;
    success = GetComputerNameA(name, ref size);
    Console.WriteLine(name.ToString());
}
```

If successful, the program should return the computer name of the current device.

## P/Invoke in PowerShell

Now that we’ve covered how it can be accomplished in .NET, let’s look at how we can adapt the same syntax to work in PowerShell.

Defining the API call is almost identical to .NET’s implementation, but we will need to create a method instead of a class and add a few additional operators.

### Method Definition:
```powershell
$MethodDefinition = @"
    [DllImport("kernel32")]
    public static extern IntPtr GetProcAddress(IntPtr hModule, string procName);
    [DllImport("kernel32")]
    public static extern IntPtr GetModuleHandle(string lpModuleName);
    [DllImport("kernel32")]
    public static extern bool VirtualProtect(IntPtr lpAddress, UIntPtr dwSize, uint flNewProtect, out uint lpflOldProtect);
"@;
```

### Additional Step:
PowerShell requires one further step before the calls can be initialized. We must create a new type for the pointer of each Win32 DLL within the method definition. The function `Add-Type` will drop a temporary file in the `/temp` directory and compile needed functions using `csc.exe`.

Example of the function being used:
```powershell
$Kernel32 = Add-Type -MemberDefinition $MethodDefinition -Name 'Kernel32' -NameSpace 'Win32' -PassThru;
```

### Using the API Calls:
Once defined, we can use the required API calls with the syntax below:
```powershell
[Win32.Kernel32]::<Imported Call>()
```
