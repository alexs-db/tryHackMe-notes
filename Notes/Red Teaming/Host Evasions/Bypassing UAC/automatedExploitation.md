# Automating UAC Bypasses

An excellent tool for testing UAC bypasses without writing exploits from scratch is **UACME**, created by [@hfiref0x](https://github.com/hfiref0x). UACME provides an up-to-date repository of UAC bypass techniques ready to use.  
Official repository: [https://github.com/hfiref0x/UACME](https://github.com/hfiref0x/UACME)

While UACME includes several tools, the primary focus here is on **Akagi**, which runs the actual UAC bypasses. You can find a compiled version of Akagi at:

```
C:\tools\UACME-Akagi64.exe
```

## Usage

Using Akagi is straightforward: specify the method number you want to test. A complete list of methods is available in the project's GitHub description.

For example, to test method 33, run the following in a command prompt:

```shell
cd \tools
UACME-Akagi64.exe 33
```

This will launch a high-integrity `cmd.exe` if successful.

## Common Methods

| Method ID | Bypass Technique                        |
|-----------|----------------------------------------|
| 33        | `fodhelper.exe`                        |
| 34        | DiskCleanup scheduled task             |
| 70        | `fodhelper.exe` using CurVer registry key |

The methods introduced in this section can be tested using the corresponding method IDs with UACME.
