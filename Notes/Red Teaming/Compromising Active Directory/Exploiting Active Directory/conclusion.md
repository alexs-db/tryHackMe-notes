## Conclusion

Exploiting Active Directory (AD) takes time to master, and the techniques used will highly depend on the configuration of the targeted AD environment. The process is cyclic: rarely will a single exploit provide Domain Admin (DA) access. Instead, the best approach is to exploit vulnerabilities to further your access, then use your new privileges to enumerate again, searching for additional attack paths from your new position.

## Mitigations

Defending against AD exploitation is challenging, as many exploitable misconfigurations may exist for legitimate business reasons. However, several measures can help reduce risk:

- **Maintain Tiering Models:**  
    Ensure that no configuration breaks the tiering model. Accounts in a lower tier should not interact with resources in a higher tier, and higher-tier accounts should never log onto lower-tier resources.

- **Principle of Least Privilege:**  
    Apply least privilege when delegating permissions. Delegation should respect the tiering model, preventing lower-tiered objects from altering higher-tiered objects.

- **Enforce SMB Signing:**  
    SMB signing should be enforced (not just enabled) to prevent credential relay attacks.

- **Secure All AD Services:**  
    AD objects and their configurations are not the only attack paths. Services such as Active Directory Certificate Services (AD CS) should also be considered part of the attack surface and secured accordingly.

- **Protect Tier 0 Infrastructure:**  
    Implement strong security controls for Tier 0 infrastructure and accounts, especially in child domains, as compromising one can lead to the compromise of the entire forest.

With AD exploitation complete, the next step is to establish persistence and ensure that defenders cannot easily remove your access. This will be covered in the next room.
