# TTPs (Tough) — The Apex of the Pyramid of Pain

It is not over yet, but good news: we have made it to the final stage—the apex of the Pyramid of Pain!

**TTPs** stands for **Tactics, Techniques & Procedures**. This encompasses the entire [MITRE ATT&CK Matrix](https://attack.mitre.org/), covering all the steps an adversary might take to achieve their goal, from phishing attempts to persistence and data exfiltration.

If you can detect and respond to TTPs quickly, you leave adversaries with almost no chance to fight back. For example, if you detect a Pass-the-Hash attack using Windows Event Log Monitoring and remediate it, you can quickly identify the compromised host and stop lateral movement within your network. At this point, the attacker has two options:

1. Go back, do more research and training, and reconfigure their custom tools.
2. Give up and find another target.

Option 2 definitely sounds less time- and resource-consuming for the attacker.
