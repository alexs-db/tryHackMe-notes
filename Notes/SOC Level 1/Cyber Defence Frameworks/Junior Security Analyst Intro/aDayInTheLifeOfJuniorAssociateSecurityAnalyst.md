# A Day in the Life of a Junior Security Analyst

Understanding the job responsibilities of a Junior (Associate) Security Analyst starts with exploring what a typical day looks likeâ€”and why this is such an exciting career path.

Being on the frontline can be challenging. You'll work with various log sources from different tools, monitor network traffic, review IPS (Intrusion Prevention System) and IDS (Intrusion Detection System) alerts, investigate suspicious emails, and extract forensic data to analyze and detect potential attacks. You'll also use open-source intelligence to help make informed decisions about alerts.

One of the most rewarding aspects of the role is successfully remediating an incident. Incident response can take hours, days, or even weeks, depending on the scale of the attack. Key questions include: Did the attacker exfiltrate any data? How much data was taken? Did the attacker attempt to pivot to other hosts? There are many questions to answer and much work to do in detection, containment, and remediation.

We'll guide you through the fundamental knowledge every Junior (Associate) Security Analyst needs to become a successful Network Defender.

The first task for almost every Junior (Associate) Security Analyst at the start of their shift is to review tickets and check for any generated alerts.
