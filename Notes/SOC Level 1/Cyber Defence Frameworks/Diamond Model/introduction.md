# Introduction to the Diamond Model of Intrusion Analysis

The **Diamond Model of Intrusion Analysis** was developed by cybersecurity professionals Sergio Caltagirone, Andrew Pendergast, and Christopher Betz in 2013.

This model is composed of four core features:

- **Adversary**
- **Infrastructure**
- **Capability**
- **Victim**

These features form the fundamental atomic element of any intrusion activity. The four core features are edge-connected, representing their underlying relationships and arranged in the shape of a diamondâ€”hence the name "Diamond Model."

You may also encounter two additional axes in the Diamond Model: **Social/Political** and **Technology**. These will be discussed in more detail later.

The Diamond Model encapsulates essential concepts of intrusion analysis and adversary operations, while remaining flexible enough to incorporate new ideas. It enables:

- Real-time integration of intelligence for network defense
- Automated correlation across events
- Confident classification of events into adversary campaigns
- Forecasting adversary operations
- Planning and simulating mitigation strategies

## Why Learn About the Diamond Model?

The Diamond Model helps you identify the elements of an intrusion. By the end of this module, you will be able to:

- Create a Diamond Model for events such as breaches, intrusions, attacks, or incidents
- Analyze Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs)

Additionally, the Diamond Model is a useful tool for explaining incidents to non-technical audiences, providing clear insights into what happened and information about malicious threat actors.
