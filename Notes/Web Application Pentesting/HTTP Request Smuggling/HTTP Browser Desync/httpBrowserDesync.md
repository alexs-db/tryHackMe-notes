# HTTP Browser Desync

In a Browser Desync attack, the attacker aims to take control of a victim's account by exploiting vulnerabilities in a web application's user connection system.

This attack occurs in two steps:

1. The initial request, appearing legitimate, is intended to disrupt the user request queue by introducing an arbitrary request.
2. Once the connection pool is compromised, the very next valid request will be replaced by the arbitrary request initiated in the previous step.

Take a look at this high-level representation of the attack:

In the diagram above, the client initiates a POST request utilizing the keep-alive feature, ensuring the connection remains persistent. This persistence allows for transmitting multiple requests within the same session. This POST request contains a hijack GET request within its body. If the web server is vulnerable, it mishandles the request body, leaving this hijack request in the connection queue. Next, when the client makes another request, the hijack GET request is added at the forefront, replacing the expected behavior.

In this scenario, attempting to access the redirect page automatically will show the output from the 404 page instead of the redirect one.
