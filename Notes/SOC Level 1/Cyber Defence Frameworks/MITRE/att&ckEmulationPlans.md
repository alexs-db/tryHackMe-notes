### Center for Threat-Informed Defense (CTID)

MITRE established the **Center for Threat-Informed Defense (CTID)**, an organization composed of various companies and vendors worldwide. CTID's mission is to research cyber threats and their Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs), sharing this knowledge to enhance cyber defense for everyone.

**Some CTID participants:**
- AttackIQ (founder)
- Verizon
- Microsoft (founder)
- Red Canary (founder)
- Splunk

> *"Together with Participant organizations, we cultivate solutions for a safer world and advance threat-informed defense with open-source software, methodologies, and frameworks. By expanding upon the MITRE ATT&CK knowledge base, our work expands the global understanding of cyber adversaries and their tradecraft with the public release of data sets critical to better understanding adversarial behavior and their movements."*

### ATT&CK速 Emulation Plans

The **Adversary Emulation Library** is a public resource providing free adversary emulation plans for blue and red teams. These emulation plans, contributed by CTID, offer step-by-step guides to mimic specific threat groups.

**Currently available ATT&CK速 Emulation Plans include:**
- APT3
- APT29
- FIN6

These plans help organizations answer questions like, "How would we fare if APT29 targeted us?" by referring to the results of executing the relevant emulation plan.
