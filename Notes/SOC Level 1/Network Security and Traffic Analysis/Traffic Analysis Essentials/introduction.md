# Introduction to Network Security and Traffic Analysis

Network Security is a set of operations for protecting data, applications, devices, and systems connected to a network. It is considered one of the significant subdomains of cybersecurity. Network Security focuses on the design, operation, and management of architecture/infrastructure to ensure network accessibility, integrity, continuity, and reliability.

Traffic analysis (often called Network Traffic Analysis) is a subdomain of Network Security. Its primary focus is investigating network data to identify problems and anomalies.

This room covers the foundations of Network Security and Traffic Analysis, introducing essential concepts to help you begin with Traffic/Packet Analysis.
