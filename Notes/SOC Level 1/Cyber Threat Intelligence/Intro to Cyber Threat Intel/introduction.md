# Cyber Threat Intelligence for SOC L1 Analysts

The modern Security Operations Centre (SOC) is a noisy place. Dashboards blink, telemetry streams in by the gigabyte, and the clock always ticks toward the next potential breach. At the front of this controlled chaos sits the Level 1 analyst—the first human touchpoint for every suspicious ping, pop‑up, or packet. This guide aims to translate the sometimes abstract discipline of Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) into everyday tasks: enriching indicators, triaging alerts, and turning raw data into actionable stories.

The goal is to move learners from _"I recognise an IP address"_ to _"I recognise why this IP address spells trouble—and I can prove it"_ by achieving the following objectives:

- Understand what threat intelligence is and why it matters to SOC analysts.
- Learn about the threat intelligence lifecycle and the indicators to look for.
- Familiarise yourself with intelligence sharing using feeds and platforms.
