## Threat Intelligence (TI) / Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI)

Threat Intelligence (TI), also known as Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI), refers to information or Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) attributed to adversaries. Leveraging threat intelligence enables defenders to make informed decisions about defensive strategies.

Large organizations may have dedicated in-house teams focused on gathering threat intelligence for other teams, in addition to using readily available threat intel. This intelligence can be sourced from open sources or through vendor subscriptions (e.g., CrowdStrike). In contrast, in smaller organizations, defenders often juggle multiple roles and must allocate time from other responsibilities to focus on threat intelligence.

To address this challenge, we will explore a scenario using the ATT&CK® framework for threat intelligence. The primary objective of threat intelligence is to make information actionable.

### Scenario

You are a security analyst in the aviation sector. Your organization is migrating its infrastructure to the cloud. Your task is to use the ATT&CK® Matrix to gather threat intelligence on APT groups that may target this sector and employ techniques relevant to your areas of concern. Review the selected group's information, including their tactics and techniques, to identify any gaps in your defensive coverage.
