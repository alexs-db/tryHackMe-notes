# MITRE ENGAGE

> "MITRE Engage is a framework for planning and discussing adversary engagement operations that empowers you to engage your adversaries and achieve your cybersecurity goals."  
> — [MITRE Engage](https://engage.mitre.org)

MITRE Engage is an **Adversary Engagement Approach** that leverages **Cyber Denial** and **Cyber Deception**:

- **Cyber Denial:** Prevents adversaries from conducting their operations.
- **Cyber Deception:** Intentionally plants artifacts to mislead adversaries.

The Engage website provides a **starter kit**—a collection of whitepapers and PDFs with checklists, methodologies, and processes to help you begin with adversary engagement.

Like MITRE ATT&CK, Engage has its own matrix:

## Engage Matrix Categories

- **Prepare:** Set operational actions to achieve your desired outcome (input).
- **Expose:** Detect adversaries when they trigger deployed deception activities.
- **Affect:** Take actions that negatively impact adversary operations.
- **Elicit:** Gather information by observing adversary behavior and learning their TTPs.
- **Understand:** Analyze the outcomes of operational actions (output).

Refer to the [Engage Handbook](https://engage.mitre.org/handbook) to learn more.

You can interact with the **Engage Matrix Explorer** and filter by information from MITRE ATT&CK. By default, the matrix focuses on **Operate**, which includes **Expose**, **Affect**, and **Elicit**. You can also focus on **Prepare** or **Understand** as needed.
