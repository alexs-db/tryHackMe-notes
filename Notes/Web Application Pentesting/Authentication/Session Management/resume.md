# Session Management

## Lifecycle Phase

### Session Creation
- A combination of cookie- and token-based session management is being used.
- A new session value is provided for each login attempt.
- The session value itself appears to be sufficiently random.

### Session Tracking
- Unauthenticated actions are not tracked via a session.
- The cookie is sent in each request for tracking.
- Several requests can be made without a cookie.
- The initial token values that are loaded post-authentication dictate the visible information.

### Session Expiry
- There is a mismatch between the client-side and server-side expiry times.
- The expiry time is incredibly long.

### Session Termination
- Users can forcibly terminate their session.
- Sessions are terminated server-side but reusing an old session leads to an internal server error.

## Vulnerabilities

Given all of this information, we would already report the following vulnerabilities on a security assessment:
- Excessive Session Lifetimes

## Further Investigation

We would also need to investigate the following further:
- Access controls on all API endpoints.
- Web application logs for the accountability of actions.
