# Rule-Based Attacks

Rule-Based attacks, also known as hybrid attacks, assume the attacker knows something about the password policy. Rules are applied to create passwords within the guidelines of the given password policy and should, in theory, only generate valid passwords. Using pre-existing wordlists may be useful when generating passwords that fit a policy â€” for example, manipulating or 'mangling' a password such as `password`: `p@ssword`, `Pa$$word`, `Passw0rd`, and so on.

For this attack, we can expand our wordlist using either `hashcat` or `John the Ripper`. Here, we will explore how `John the Ripper` works. Usually, `John the Ripper` has a config file that contains rule sets, which is located at `/etc/john/john.conf` or `/opt/john/john.conf` depending on your distro or how John was installed. You can read `/etc/john/john.conf` and look for `List.Rules` to see all the available rules:

```bash
user@machine$ cat /etc/john/john.conf | grep "List.Rules:" | cut -d"." -f3 | cut -d":" -f2 | cut -d"]" -f1 | awk NF

```

We can see that many rules are available for us to use. We will create a wordlist with only one password containing the string `tryhackme` to see how we can expand the wordlist. Let's choose one of the rules, the `best64` rule, which contains the best 64 built-in John rules, and see what it can do!

```bash
user@machine$ john --wordlist=/tmp/single-password-list.txt --rules=best64 --stdout | wc -l
Using default input encoding: UTF-8
Press 'q' or Ctrl-C to abort, almost any other key for status
76p 0:00:00:00 100.00% (2021-10-11 13:42) 1266p/s pordpo
76
```

- `--wordlist=` specifies the wordlist or dictionary file.
- `--rules` specifies which rule or rules to use.
- `--stdout` prints the output to the terminal.
- `| wc -l` counts how many lines John produced.

By running the previous command, we expand our password list from 1 to 76 passwords. Now let's check another rule, one of the best rules in John, `KoreLogic`. `KoreLogic` uses various built-in and custom rules to generate complex password lists. For more information, please visit the official documentation. Now let's use this rule and check whether the `Tryh@ckm3` is available in our list!

```bash
user@machine$ john --wordlist=single-password-list.txt --rules=KoreLogic --stdout | grep "Tryh@ckm3"
Using default input encoding: UTF-8
Press 'q' or Ctrl-C to abort, almost any other key for status
Tryh@ckm3
7089833p 0:00:00:02 100.00% (2021-10-11 13:56) 3016Kp/s tryhackme999999
```

The output from the previous command shows that our list has the complex version of `tryhackme`, which is `Tryh@ckm3`. Finally, we recommend checking out all the rules and finding one that works the best for you. Many rules apply combinations to an existing wordlist and expand the wordlist to increase the chance of finding a valid password!

# Custom Rules

`John the Ripper` has a lot to offer. For instance, we can build our own rule(s) and use it at runtime while John is cracking the hash or use the rule to build a custom wordlist!

Let's say we wanted to create a custom wordlist from a pre-existing dictionary with custom modifications to the original dictionary. The goal is to add special characters (e.g., `!@#$*&`) to the beginning of each word and add numbers `0-9` at the end. The format will be as follows:

```
[symbols]word[0-9]
```

We can add our rule to the end of `john.conf`:

```bash
user@machine$ sudo vi /etc/john/john.conf
[List.Rules:THM-Password-Attacks]
Az"[0-9]" ^[!@#$]
```

- `[List.Rules:THM-Password-Attacks]` specifies the rule name `THM-Password-Attacks`.
- `Az` represents a single word from the original wordlist/dictionary using `-p`.
- `"[0-9]"` appends a single digit (from 0 to 9) to the end of the word. For two digits, we can add `"[0-9][0-9]"` and so on.
- `^[!@#$]` adds a special character at the beginning of each word. `^` means the beginning of the line/word. Note, changing `^` to `$` will append the special characters to the end of the line/word.

Now let's create a file containing a single word password to see how we can expand our wordlist using this rule.

```bash
user@machine$ echo "password" > /tmp/single.lst
```

We include the name of the rule we created in the John command using the `--rules` option. We also need to show the result in the terminal. We can do this by using `--stdout` as follows:

```bash
user@machine$ john --wordlist=/tmp/single.lst --rules=THM-Password-Attacks --stdout
Using default input encoding: UTF-8
!password0
@password0
#password0
$password0
```

Now it's practice time to create your own rule!
