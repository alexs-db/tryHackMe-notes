# What is AV Software?

Antivirus (AV) software is an extra layer of security that aims to detect and prevent the execution and spread of malicious files in a target operating system.

It is a host-based application that runs in real-time (in the background) to monitor and check the current and newly downloaded files. The AV software inspects and decides whether files are malicious using different techniques, which will be covered later in this room.

Interestingly, the first antivirus software was designed solely to detect and remove computer viruses. Nowadays, that has changed; modern antivirus applications can detect and remove computer viruses as well as other harmful files and threats.

## What Does AV Software Look For?

Traditional AV software looks for malware with predefined malicious patterns or signatures. Malware is harmful software whose primary goal is to cause damage to a target machine, including but not limited to:

- Gaining full access to a target machine.
- Stealing sensitive information such as passwords.
- Encrypting files and causing damage to files.
- Injecting other malicious software or unwanted advertisements.
- Using the compromised machine to perform further attacks such as botnet attacks.

## AV vs Other Security Products

In addition to AV software, other host-based security solutions provide real-time protection to endpoint devices. Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) is a security solution that provides real-time protection based on behavioral analytics. 

- **Antivirus (AV):** Performs scanning, detecting, and removing malicious files.
- **EDR:** Monitors various security checks in the target machine, including file activities, memory, network connections, Windows registry, processes, etc.

Modern antivirus products integrate traditional antivirus features with advanced functionalities (similar to EDR functionalities) into one product to provide comprehensive protection against digital threats.

## AV Software in the Past and Present

McAfee Associates, Inc. started the first AV software implementation in 1987. It was called "VirusScan," and its main goal at that time was to remove a virus named "Brain" that infected John McAfee's computer. Later, other companies joined the battle against viruses. AV software was initially called scanners, and they were command-line tools that searched for malicious patterns in files.

Since then, things have changed. Modern AV software now uses a Graphical User Interface (GUI) to perform scans for malicious files and other tasks. Malware programs have also expanded in scope and now target victims on Windows and other operating systems. 

Modern AV software supports most devices and platforms, including:

- Windows
- Linux
- macOS
- Android
- iOS

Modern AV software has improved and become more intelligent and sophisticated, offering a bundle of versatile features, including:

- Antivirus
- Anti-Exploit
- Firewall
- Encryption tools

We will be discussing some AV features in the next task.
