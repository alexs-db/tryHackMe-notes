## Conclusion

The Cyber Kill Chain is a valuable tool for improving network defense, but it is not perfect and should not be the sole framework relied upon.

The traditional Cyber Kill Chain, also known as the Lockheed Martin Cyber Kill Chain, was last updated in 2011â€”the year it was established. The lack of updates and modifications since then has led to security gaps.

Originally, the framework was designed to secure network perimeters and defend against malware threats. However, cybersecurity threats have evolved significantly. Adversaries now combine multiple TTPs (tactics, techniques, and procedures) to achieve their objectives and can evade threat intelligence by altering file hashes and IP addresses. In response, security vendors are developing technologies such as artificial intelligence and advanced algorithms to detect even subtle suspicious changes.

A key limitation of the traditional Cyber Kill Chain is its focus on malware delivery and network security, which makes it ineffective at identifying insider threats. According to CISA, "The Insider Threat is the potential for an insider to use their authorized access or understanding of an organization to harm that organization."

Therefore, it is recommended not to rely solely on the traditional Cyber Kill Chain model. Consider also using frameworks like MITRE ATT&CK and the Unified Kill Chain to adopt a more comprehensive approach to your defense strategies.
