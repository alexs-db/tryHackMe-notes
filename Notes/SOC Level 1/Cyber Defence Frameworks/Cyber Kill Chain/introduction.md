# Introduction to the Cyber Kill Chain

The **kill chain** is a military concept describing the structure of an attack, which includes target identification, decision and order to attack, and ultimately, target destruction.

In 2011, **Lockheed Martin**, a global security and aerospace company, adapted this concept for cybersecurity, creating the **Cyber Kill ChainÂ® framework**. This framework outlines the steps adversaries or malicious actors follow during a cyber attack. To succeed, an adversary must progress through all phases of the Kill Chain. Understanding these phases helps defenders recognize adversary techniques and improve their defenses.

## Why is the Cyber Kill Chain Important?

The Cyber Kill Chain helps you:

- Understand and protect against ransomware, security breaches, and Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs).
- Assess your network and system security by identifying missing controls and closing security gaps.
- Recognize intrusion attempts and understand intruder goals as a SOC Analyst, Security Researcher, Threat Hunter, or Incident Responder.

## Attack Phases Covered

In this room, we will explore the following phases of the Cyber Kill Chain:

1. **Reconnaissance**
2. **Weaponization**
3. **Delivery**
4. **Exploitation**
5. **Installation**
6. **Command & Control**
7. **Actions on Objectives**

## Learning Objectives

- Understand each phase of the Cyber Kill Chain Framework.
- Learn the advantages and disadvantages of the traditional Cyber Kill Chain.

## Outcome

By the end of this room, you will be able to:

- Recognize the different phases of an attack.
- Break the "kill chain" to defend against adversaries.
