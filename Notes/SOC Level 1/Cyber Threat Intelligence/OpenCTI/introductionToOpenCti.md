# Introduction to OpenCTI

Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) is often a managerial challenge, with organizations struggling to input, digest, analyze, and present threat data in a meaningful way. As highlighted in the overview, numerous platforms have been developed to address the complexities of Threat Intelligence.

## What is OpenCTI?

**OpenCTI** is an open-source platform designed to help organizations manage CTI by enabling the storage, analysis, visualization, and presentation of threat campaigns, malware, and Indicators of Compromise (IOCs).

## Objective

Developed through the collaboration of the French National Cybersecurity Agency (ANSSI), OpenCTI aims to provide a comprehensive tool for leveraging both technical and non-technical information. It allows users to build relationships between each piece of information and its primary source. The platform supports structuring data using the MITRE ATT&CK framework and can be integrated with other threat intelligence tools such as MISP and TheHive. Links to these tools are provided in the overview.
