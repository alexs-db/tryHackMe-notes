# Adversary

An **adversary**—also known as an attacker, enemy, cyber threat actor, or hacker—is the person or group behind a cyberattack. Cyberattacks can involve instructions or breaches.

According to the creators of the Diamond Model, an adversary is an actor or organization responsible for utilizing a capability against a victim to achieve their intent. Adversary knowledge is often limited or unknown, especially at the time of discovery.

Understanding the distinction between an **adversary operator** and an **adversary customer** is important. This helps clarify intent, attribution, adaptability, and persistence in the relationship between an adversary and a victim.

Identifying an adversary during the early stages of a cyberattack is challenging. However, analyzing data from incidents or breaches, signatures, and other relevant information can help determine who the adversary might be.

- **Adversary Operator**: The “hacker” or person(s) conducting the intrusion activity.
- **Adversary Customer**: The entity that benefits from the intrusion. This may be the same as the operator or a separate person or group.

> **Example:**  
> An adversary customer could control multiple operators simultaneously. Each operator may have its own capabilities and infrastructure.
