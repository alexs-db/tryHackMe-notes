# Next-Generation Network IPS (NGNIPS)

According to Gartner, a Next-Generation Network IPS (NGNIPS) has the following five characteristics:

1. **Standard first-generation IPS capabilities:**  
    An NGNIPS should provide all the functionalities of a traditional network IPS.

2. **Application awareness and full-stack visibility:**  
    It must identify traffic from various applications and enforce network security policies, with visibility up to the application layer.

3. **Context-awareness:**  
    Utilizes information from external sources to assist in blocking decisions.

4. **Content awareness:**  
    Inspects and classifies files (e.g., executables, documents) in both inbound and outbound traffic.

5. **Agile engine:**  
    Supports upgrade paths to leverage new information feeds.

> **Note:**  
> Since Next-Generation Firewalls (NGFW) provide similar functionality as IPS, the term NGNIPS is becoming less common in favor of NGFW.
