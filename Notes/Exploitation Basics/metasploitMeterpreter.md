# Key Meterpreter Commands for Post-Exploitation

### General Help
- `help`: Displays all commands available for your current Meterpreter version, which may vary across versions.

### Core Commands
- `background`: Send the session to the background.
- `getuid`: Shows the user account Meterpreter is running under, indicating privilege level (e.g., NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM).
- `ps`: Lists all running processes, displaying their PID to use for migrations.
- `migrate <PID>`: Switches Meterpreter to another process by specifying its PID. Be careful with privilege loss if migrating from a high-privilege to a low-privilege process.

### Password Dumping
- `hashdump`: Displays contents of the SAM database, showing NTLM password hashes for accounts on the system, which can be used in pass-the-hash attacks.

### File Search
- `search -f <filename>`: Locates files on the target, like flag files in CTFs or configuration files during real assessments.

### Shell Access
- `shell`: Starts a command-line shell on the target. Use CTRL+Z to return to Meterpreter.
