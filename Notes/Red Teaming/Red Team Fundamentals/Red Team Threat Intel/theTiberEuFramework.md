# TIBER-EU Framework

TIBER-EU (Threat Intelligence-based Ethical Red Teaming) is a common framework developed by the European Central Bank that centers around the use of threat intelligence.

From the ECB TIBER-EU white paper:

> "The Framework for Threat Intelligence-based Ethical Red Teaming (TIBER-EU) enables European and national authorities to work with financial infrastructures and institutions (hereafter referred to collectively as 'entities') to put in place a programme to test and improve their resilience against sophisticated cyber attacks."

The main difference between this framework and others is the "Testing" phase that requires threat intelligence to feed the red team's testing.

This framework encompasses a best practice rather than anything actionable from a red team perspective.

There are several public white papers and documents if you are interested in reading about this framework further:
