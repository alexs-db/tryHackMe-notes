## Host Artifacts (Annoying)

Let's take another step up to the yellow zone.

At this level, the attacker will feel more annoyed and frustrated if you can detect the attack. The attacker would need to circle back and change their attack tools and methodologies. This is very time-consuming and will likely require them to spend more resources on their adversary tools.

**Host artifacts** are traces or observables that attackers leave on the system, such as:

- Registry values
- Suspicious process executions
- Attack patterns or IOCs (Indicators of Compromise)
- Files dropped by malicious applications
- Anything exclusive to the current threat

### Examples

- **Suspicious process execution from Word:**  
    _e.g., Microsoft Word spawning PowerShell or cmd.exe_

- **Suspicious events after opening a malicious application:**  
    _e.g., Unexpected network connections or privilege escalation attempts_

- **Files modified or dropped by the malicious actor:**  
    _e.g., Unknown executables or scripts appearing in system directories_
