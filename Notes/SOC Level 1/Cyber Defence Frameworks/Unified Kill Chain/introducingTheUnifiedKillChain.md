To continue from the previous task, Paul Pols' Unified Kill Chain (UKC), published in 2017, aims to complement (not compete with) other cybersecurity kill chain frameworks, such as Lockheed Martin’s and MITRE’s ATT&CK.

The UKC defines 18 phases of an attack, covering everything from reconnaissance to data exfiltration and understanding an attacker's motive. For brevity, these phases have been grouped into a few areas of focus in this room, which will be detailed in the remaining tasks.

Some key benefits of the UKC over traditional cybersecurity kill chain frameworks include its modern approach and high level of detail (18 phases officially, whereas other frameworks may have only a few).

| Benefits of the Unified Kill Chain (UKC) Framework | How do Other Frameworks Compare? |
|----------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| Modern (released in 2017, updated in 2022).        | Some frameworks, such as MITRE’s, were released in 2013, when the cybersecurity landscape was very different. |
| Extremely detailed (18 phases).                    | Other frameworks often have a small handful of phases. |
| Covers the entire attack lifecycle—from reconnaissance, exploitation, post-exploitation, to identifying an attacker's motivation. | Other frameworks cover a limited number of phases. |
| Highlights more realistic attack scenarios, where various stages can re-occur (e.g., after exploiting a machine, an attacker may begin reconnaissance again to pivot to another system). | Other frameworks do not account for attackers moving back and forth between phases during an attack. |
