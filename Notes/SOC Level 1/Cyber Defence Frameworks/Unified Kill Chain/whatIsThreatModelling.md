# What Is Threat Modelling?

Threat modelling, in a cybersecurity context, is a structured process aimed at improving the security of a system. It focuses on identifying risks and generally involves the following steps:

1. **Identifying Assets:**  
    Determine which systems and applications need to be secured and understand their roles within the environment. For example, is the system critical to operations, or does it store sensitive information such as payment details or addresses?

2. **Assessing Vulnerabilities:**  
    Evaluate the potential vulnerabilities and weaknesses in these systems and applications, and consider how they might be exploited.

3. **Planning Mitigations:**  
    Develop a plan of action to secure these systems and applications against the identified vulnerabilities.

4. **Implementing Policies:**  
    Establish policies to prevent these vulnerabilities from reoccurring where possible. This could include implementing a software development life cycle (SDLC) or providing phishing awareness training to employees.

Threat modelling is crucial for reducing risk within a system or application. It provides a high-level overview of an organisation's IT assets (software or hardware) and outlines procedures to address vulnerabilities.

The **Unified Kill Chain (UKC)** can support threat modelling by helping to identify potential attack surfaces and understanding how systems may be exploited.

Frameworks such as **STRIDE**, **DREAD**, and **CVSS** are commonly used in threat modelling. For further learning, consider exploring the “Principles of Security” room on TryHackMe.
