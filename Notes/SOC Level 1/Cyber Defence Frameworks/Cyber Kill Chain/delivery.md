## Delivery Phase

The **Delivery** phase is when the attacker chooses the method for transmitting the payload or malware. There are several common delivery methods:

### 1. Phishing Email

After conducting reconnaissance and identifying targets, the attacker crafts a malicious email. This could be a spearphishing attack (targeting a specific person) or a broader campaign. The email contains a payload or malware.

**Example:**  
An attacker learns that Nancy from the Sales department at Company A frequently interacts with Scott, a Service Delivery Manager at Company B, on LinkedIn. Assuming they communicate via work email, the attacker crafts an email impersonating Scott, using a similar domain name. The attacker sends Nancy a fake "Invoice" email containing the malicious payload.

### 2. Infected USB Drives

Attackers may distribute infected USB drives in public places such as coffee shops, parking lots, or on the street. A more sophisticated approach involves printing the company's logo on the USB drives and mailing them to the company, pretending to be a customer sending gifts.

### 3. Watering Hole Attack

A watering hole attack targets a specific group by compromising a website they frequently visit, redirecting them to a malicious site. The attacker exploits a known vulnerability on the website and encourages victims to visit it, often by sending seemingly harmless emails with the malicious URL.

After visiting the compromised site, victims may unintentionally download malware or a malicious applicationâ€”a tactic known as a **drive-by download**.

**Example:**  
A malicious pop-up prompts the user to download a fake browser extension.
