## Hash Values (Trivial)

As per Microsoft, a hash value is a numeric value of fixed length that uniquely identifies data. It is the result of a hashing algorithm. Here are some of the most common hashing algorithms:

- **MD5 (Message Digest 5, RFC 1321):**  
    Designed by Ron Rivest in 1992, MD5 produces a 128-bit hash value. MD5 is **not** considered cryptographically secure. In 2011, RFC 6151 detailed several attacks against MD5, including hash collisions.

- **SHA-1 (Secure Hash Algorithm 1, RFC 3174):**  
    Invented by the NSA in 1995, SHA-1 produces a 160-bit hash value (40-digit hexadecimal). NIST deprecated SHA-1 in 2011 and banned its use for digital signatures at the end of 2013 due to vulnerabilities. Migration to SHA-2 or SHA-3 is recommended.

- **SHA-2 (Secure Hash Algorithm 2):**  
    Designed by NIST and NSA in 2001 to replace SHA-1. SHA-2 has several variants, with SHA-256 being the most common. SHA-256 produces a 256-bit hash value (64-digit hexadecimal).

A hash is **not** considered cryptographically secure if two files can have the same hash value (a collision).

Security professionals use hash values to identify malware samples, suspicious files, and to uniquely reference malicious artifacts.

Ransomware reports often include hashes of malicious files. For examples, see [The DFIR Report](https://thedfirreport.com/) and [Trellix Threat Research Blogs](https://www.trellix.com/en-us/about/newsroom/stories.html).

### Online Hash Lookup Tools

- [VirusTotal](https://www.virustotal.com/)
- [MetaDefender Cloud - OPSWAT](https://metadefender.opswat.com/)

These tools allow you to look up file hashes to check for known malicious files.

It is easy to spot a malicious file if you have its hash. However, attackers can trivially modify a file (even by a single bit), resulting in a completely different hash value. With many variants of malware, threat hunting using file hashes as Indicators of Compromise (IOCs) can be challenging.

## Example: Changing a File's Hash Value

You can change a file's hash by simply appending a string to it. Hereâ€™s how it looks in PowerShell:

**File Hash (Before Modification):**
```powershell
PS C:\Users\THM\Downloads> Get-FileHash .\OpenVPN_2.5.1_I601_amd64.msi -Algorithm MD5

Algorithm Hash                             Path                                                 
--------- ----                             ----                                                 
MD5       D1A008E3A606F24590A02B853E955CF7 C:\Users\THM\Downloads\OpenVPN_2.5.1_I601_amd64.msi
```

**Modify the File:**
```powershell
PS C:\Users\THM\Downloads> echo "AppendTheHash" >> .\OpenVPN_2.5.1_I601_amd64.msi
```

**File Hash (After Modification):**
```powershell
PS C:\Users\THM\Downloads> Get-FileHash .\OpenVPN_2.5.1_I601_amd64.msi -Algorithm MD5

Algorithm Hash                             Path                                                 
--------- ----                             ----                                                 
MD5       9D52B46F5DE41B73418F8E0DACEC5E9F C:\Users\THM\Downloads\OpenVPN_2.5.1_I601_amd64.msi
```

As shown, even a small change results in a completely different hash value.
