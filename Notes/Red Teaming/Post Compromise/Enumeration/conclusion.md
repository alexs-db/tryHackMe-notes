# Post Compromise Enumeration - Conclusion

The focus of this room was on built-in command-line tools in both Linux and MS Windows systems. Many commands exist in both systems, although the command arguments and resulting output are different. The following tables show the primary Linux and MS Windows commands that we relied on to get more information about the system.

## Linux Commands

| Command              | Description                                   |
|----------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| `hostname`           | Shows the systemâ€™s hostname                  |
| `who`                | Shows who is logged in                       |

| `last`               | Shows a listing of the last logged-in users  |
