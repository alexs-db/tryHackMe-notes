# Infrastructure

Infrastructure refers to the software or hardware—both physical and logical interconnections—that an adversary uses to deliver or maintain control of their capabilities. Examples include command and control (C2) centers and data exfiltration channels.

Infrastructure can take many forms, such as:

- IP addresses
- Domain names
- Email addresses
- Malicious USB devices (e.g., a USB drive found and plugged into a workstation)

## Types of Infrastructure

- **Type 1 Infrastructure:** Controlled or owned directly by the adversary.
- **Type 2 Infrastructure:** Controlled by an intermediary, who may or may not be aware of its use. This is the infrastructure visible to the victim and is used to obfuscate the source and attribution of the activity. Examples include malware staging servers, malicious domain names, and compromised email accounts.

## Service Providers

Service providers are organizations that offer critical services enabling the availability of Type 1 and Type 2 infrastructures. Examples include:

- Internet Service Providers (ISPs)
- Domain registrars
- Webmail providers
